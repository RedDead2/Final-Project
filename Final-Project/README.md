# Final-Project
Final project for Advanced Digital Geographies 458

This project focuses on the fertility rate difference between Pierce County and King County and looks at fertility based on nativity, foreign-born, education attainment, and child-bearing age. We have create two different maps(interactive and static) to showcase the differnces.

We gathered data from the ACS for fertility rates and shapefile for pierce and king counties from the open data portla for the respective county.

we displayed the fertility data at natural jenks because we believed that was the most accurate way to display it.
