##Question

How does educational attainment and age affect birth rates among foreign-born and native-born women in King County and Pierce County, WA?

##Issues with Data

U.S. Census data on birth rates of foreign-born birth rates may be non-representative of the true birth rates among foreign born. This is because many undocumented immigrants are undercounted in the decennial census. So, true totals of foreign-born births would be inflated due to illegal migration. 

##Relevance of the Question

The U.S. Census Bureau provides socioeconomic data on foreign-born versus native-born populations. Findings from the Census Bureau indicate that foreign-born populations earn less, are more impoverished, and have lower educational attainment than native-born populations. These findings may be similar to the socioeconomic characteristics of foreign-born populations in King and Pierce County, WA. A cartographic comparison between foreign-born and native-born women in King and Pierce County would therefore be useful, as it could indicate which populations are in greater need of government assistance or other types of benefits.

##Contextualizing the Question

Native born: The Census Bureau defines native or native born as anyone in the U.S., Puerto Rico, a U.S. Island Area, or of a U.S. citizen parent or parents.

Birth rate: number of live births per 1,000 of population per year

Fertility rate: number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age generally ages 15 to 44.

Educational Attainment: defined as the highest grade completed in the educational system within a selected population. In this case, births in the past year per 1,000 women whose educational attainment equals less than a high school diploma.
